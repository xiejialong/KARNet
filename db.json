Given a natural language description of a desired object in the scene, a human is able to adeptly listen for the gist of the description and understand linguistic and visual concepts, then perceive and delimit the referred object, and ultimately grasp the target by factoring in the physical attribute such as shape, scale, and spatial location. This process is similarly applicable to robots. The visual attributes serve to constrain the both width and position of the grasping rectangle, thereby preventing collisions with other objects in the clutter.<br><img src=\"/xiejialong/KARNet/./images/Schematic.jpg\" alt=\"listen-perceive-grasp paradigm\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"Overview-of-CTNet\"><a href=\"#Overview-of-CTNet\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Overview of CTNet\"></a>Overview of CTNet</h2><p>An overview of CTNet architecture.
